# Basic Mode Instant Response Fix

## Issue
Basic mode queries were showing a "PROCESSING YOUR REQUEST" state instead of providing instant responses. The visualization panel on the left and the response in the middle panel should appear immediately for basic mode.

## Root Cause
The frontend was setting `isProcessingVoice(true)` and `isThinking(true)` for all modes, including basic mode. This caused the UI to show a processing state even though the backend was sending responses immediately.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Modified `sendVoiceCommand` Function
```typescript
// Only set thinking state for reasoning and deep-research modes
if (actualMode === 'reasoning' || actualMode === 'deep-research') {
  setIsThinking(true);
  setIsProcessingVoice(true);
} else {
  // For basic mode, don't show processing state
  setIsThinking(false);
  setIsProcessingVoice(false);
  // Immediately set visualization data for basic mode
  setVisualizationData({
    query: command,
    mode: actualMode,
    model: 'sonar',
    content: '',
    citations: []
  });
}
```

### 2. Updated `handleVoiceResponse` Function
```typescript
// For basic mode, immediately clear processing states
if (message.data?.mode === 'basic') {
  setIsThinking(false);
  setIsProcessingVoice(false);
  setIsReceiving(true);
}
```

## Result
Now when users make basic queries:
1. The left panel immediately shows the query visualization
2. The middle panel shows the response instantly without any processing state
3. The right panel searches for YouTube videos based on the query
4. The voice response starts playing immediately via ElevenLabs

## How It Works

### Basic Mode (Instant)
- Query: "tell me about coffee"
- Left Panel: Shows coffee visualization immediately
- Middle Panel: Shows Monday's response instantly
- Right Panel: Searches for coffee tutorial videos
- No "PROCESSING YOUR REQUEST" state

### Reasoning Mode (Processing State)
- Query: "think about why coffee is popular"
- Shows "PROCESSING YOUR REQUEST" with Sonar Reasoning Pro
- Progressive updates as reasoning happens
- Final response when complete

### Deep Research Mode (Processing State)
- Query: "research into coffee cultivation"
- Shows "PROCESSING YOUR REQUEST" with Sonar Deep Research
- Progressive research updates
- Comprehensive response when complete

## Testing
You can test by saying:
- "Hey Monday, tell me about coffee" - Should show instant response
- "Hey Monday, think about why coffee is bitter" - Should show processing state
- "Hey Monday, research into coffee history" - Should show processing state
