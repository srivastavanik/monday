# API Key Configuration Fix - RESOLVED ✅

## ElevenLabs API Authentication Issue - FIXED

### Issue
The application was receiving a 401 Unauthorized error from the ElevenLabs API.

### Root Cause Found
After testing, we discovered that:
- ✅ **The API key IS VALID**: `sk_6be41ddad8e1f62baabff7344e221588d655f06c35823991`
- ❌ **The voice ID was INVALID**: `21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM` doesn't exist in your account

### Fix Applied
Updated both applications to use **Sarah's voice** which is available in your account:
- **Voice ID**: `EXAVITQu4vr4xnSDxMaL`
- **Voice Name**: Sarah

### Available Voices in Your Account
Your ElevenLabs account has these voices available:
1. **Aria** (9BWtsMINqrJLrRacOk9x)
2. **Sarah** (EXAVITQu4vr4xnSDxMaL) ← Currently using this one
3. **Laura** (FGY2WhTYpPnrIDTdsKH5)
4. **Charlie** (IKne3meq5aSn9XLyUdCD)
5. **George** (JBFqnCBsd6RMkjVDRZzb)

### Files Updated
