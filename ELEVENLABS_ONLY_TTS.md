# ElevenLabs-Only Text-to-Speech Implementation

## Overview
All Web Speech API synthesis has been removed from the codebase. The system now exclusively uses ElevenLabs for text-to-speech functionality.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated useTextToSpeech Hook
**Files Modified:**
- `/hooks/useTextToSpeech.ts`
- `/nidsmonday/hooks/useTextToSpeech.ts`

**Changes:**
- Removed `fallbackToWebSpeech` function entirely
- Removed all `window.speechSynthesis` usage
- Removed `SpeechSynthesisUtterance` usage
- Simplified `speak()` function to only use ElevenLabs API
- Removed Web Speech API fallback logic
- Updated error handling to log errors without fallback

### 2. Updated VoiceSystemController
**Files Modified:**
- `/monday/monday-learning-amalgamated/frontend/src/controllers/VoiceSystemController.ts`
- `/nidsmonday/monday/monday-learning-amalgamated/frontend/src/controllers/VoiceSystemController.ts`

**Changes:**
- Removed `window.speechSynthesis.cancel()` call in emergency reset

## Behavior

### Success Path
1. When `speak()` is called, it checks for ElevenLabs API key and voice ID
2. Makes HTTP request to ElevenLabs API
3. Plays the returned audio using HTML5 Audio element
4. Handles completion and cleanup

### Error Handling
- If API key or voice ID is missing: Logs error, no speech
- If ElevenLabs API fails: Logs error, no speech
- If audio playback fails: Logs error, no speech

## Requirements
- Valid ElevenLabs API key
- Valid ElevenLabs voice ID
- Both are currently configured in the application:
  - API Key: `sk_6be41ddad8e1f62baabff7344e221588d655f06c35823991`
  - Voice ID: `21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM`

## Benefits
- Consistent voice quality across all browsers
- No browser compatibility issues
- Single TTS implementation to maintain
- Better control over voice parameters
- Professional voice quality

## Important Notes
- The system will not speak if ElevenLabs credentials are missing
- There is no fallback mechanism - ElevenLabs is required for all TTS
- Audio context initialization is still performed for optimal playback
- Progress updates also use ElevenLabs (at lower volume)
