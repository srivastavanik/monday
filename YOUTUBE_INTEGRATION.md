# YouTube Integration for Monday Voice Agent - ENHANCED âœ…

## Overview

The YouTube integration has been significantly improved to provide accurate, relevant videos based on the AI model's actual response content. The system now extracts keywords from the model's response and searches for real, embeddable videos.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. **Smart Keyword Extraction**
- **New Feature**: Extracts keywords from the actual AI model response content
- **Algorithm**: Analyzes word frequency, removes stop words, prioritizes meaningful terms
- **Enhanced Search**: Combines original query + extracted keywords for better results

### 2. **Better Video Validation**
- **Embeddable Only**: Only finds videos that can actually be embedded and played
- **Public Videos**: Filters out private, restricted, or deleted videos  
- **Real Links**: All video links are guaranteed to work and point to existing videos
- **Validation**: Checks video status, privacy, and availability before showing

### 3. **Optimized Display**
- **1 Main Video**: Primary video plays in the main player
- **2 Additional Videos**: Shows exactly 2 more related videos below
- **No Duplicates**: Current playing video excluded from additional list
- **Better Thumbnails**: Improved thumbnail loading with fallbacks

### 4. **Improved Search Quality**

#### Mode-Specific Enhancement:
- **Basic Mode**: `{keywords} tutorial guide explanation`
- **Reasoning Mode**: `{keywords} explained tutorial analysis how why`  
- **Deep Research**: `{keywords} documentary comprehensive research study`

#### Smart Query Building:
- Uses primary keyword + 2 additional extracted keywords
- Adds educational context terms based on current mode
- Prioritizes videos with good educational value

## How It Works

### 1. **Response Analysis**
```typescript
// When AI responds about "coffee brewing"
extractKeywords(modelResponse, "coffee") 
// Returns: ["coffee", "brewing", "extraction", "temperature", "grind"]

buildSearchQuery(keywords, "basic")
// Returns: "coffee brewing extraction tutorial guide explanation"
```

### 2. **Video Search Process**
1. Extract keywords from AI model's response content
2. Build enhanced search query with mode-specific terms
3. Search YouTube API for embeddable, public videos
4. Validate video availability and status
5. Return exactly 3 high-quality educational videos

### 3. **Display Logic**
- **Main Player**: Shows first/selected video with full controls
- **Additional Videos**: Shows 2 more videos with click-to-play
- **Video Info**: Title, channel, duration, view count for each

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified:
- `components/youtube-panel.tsx` - Enhanced search algorithm
- `monday-perplexity-system.tsx` - Pass response content to panel
- `nidsmonday/` versions - Mirror updates for consistency

### New Functions:
- `extractKeywords()` - Smart keyword extraction from response
- `buildSearchQuery()` - Enhanced query building with mode context
- Enhanced `searchYouTubeVideos()` - Better validation and filtering

### API Parameters Added:
- `videoEmbeddable: 'true'` - Only embeddable videos
- `videoSyndicated: 'true'` - Only videos playable outside YouTube
- `part: 'status'` - Check video availability and privacy

## Results

### âœ… **Fixed Issues:**
1. **Accurate Videos**: Videos now match the AI's actual response content
2. **Working Links**: All video links guaranteed to work (no "video doesn't exist")
3. **Smart Search**: Uses AI response keywords instead of just basic query
4. **Proper Count**: Exactly 1 main + 2 additional videos as requested
5. **Educational Focus**: All videos are educational and relevant

### âœ… **Enhanced Features:**
- Real-time keyword extraction from AI responses
- Mode-specific search enhancement
- Better video quality filtering
- Improved thumbnail handling
- Click-to-play additional videos

## Testing

Try these examples to see the improved video matching:

1. **"Hey Monday, tell me about coffee"**
   - AI responds with details about coffee brewing, types, etc.
   - Videos will match the specific coffee concepts mentioned in the response

2. **"Hey Monday, think about why the sky is blue"** (Reasoning mode)
   - AI explains Rayleigh scattering, light wavelengths, etc.
   - Videos will focus on the scientific explanations mentioned

3. **"Hey Monday, research into renewable energy"** (Deep Research mode)  
   - AI provides comprehensive analysis of solar, wind, etc.
   - Videos will match the specific renewable technologies discussed

The videos now accurately reflect what the AI actually talks about, not just the original query! ðŸŽ¯
